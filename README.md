Changes Made to Popup.html and popup.css

New Buttons and Modifications:

- Copy: Used to copy the content window where generated text is displayed.
- Edit in New Tab: Users can open a new tab to edit the mail in a larger window.
- Reply To: Functions similarly to the old "Choose" button.
- Generate: Functions the same as the old "Generate" button. I relocated it and grouped it with the Tone and Purpose dropdown menus, creating a generator section.
  
Dropdown Menus:

- Tone Dropdown: Removed the old select and added a dropdown menu.
- Response Dropdown: Removed the old select and added a dropdown menu.
  
Content/Textarea:

- Disabled resizing by the user and added default text.
  
Footer:

- The new footer includes a version viewer and links to what powers our project.
  
Header:

- Placeholder for future icon and the plugin's name.

Popup.css

- general css wise only noteworthy change is the new reset script. old one wasnt cleaning all of it. some comments to seperate objects and there respected css scripts.

Added a bunch of comments regarding what needs to be done. Someone also needs to merge our new changes into dev so we can have a working branch for future alterations.
